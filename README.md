- 👋 Hi, I’m @DDonlien, a car engineer and a guitarist
- 👀 I’m interested in too many things but pertically in anything that moves (especially cars)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning coding basics because I have absolute no CS back ground
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on some "music apps with dedicated use" and/or "vehicle control system (as a new fan for RC Cars and Driving Simulator)"
- 📫 You can reach me via my email: ddonlien@outlook.com
